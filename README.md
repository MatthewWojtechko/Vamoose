Vamoose was created by Matthew Wojtechko and Jess Jaynes. All rights reserved.

Over the span of six months, three iterations of Vamoose were developed.
My classmate Jess Jaynes and I bore the idea in Fall 2018 and proceeded to together created a single-level game for a project in a game development class at college.
After this, we built upon the game for another class project, adding enemies and two more levels.
As the first big foray into game development for Jess and I it was a huge learning experience, and the game suffered from faulty platforming controls, crude visuals, and unpolished level design.
Ultimately, this version only served as a prototype of what the game would soon become. Throughout the Spring semester and summer I reworked the game outside of class.
I created and animated new character and enemy designs, corrected the controls, overhauled the level design and lava movement, added new audio-visual effects, added in new features like an assist mode,
fixed bugs, and more. It’s still a short game by most gamers’ standards, but what's there is well polished. For my first original game, it was a huge success.
